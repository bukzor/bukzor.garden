## 2026-02-03: Board Rendering

**Focus:** Basic 3x3 board rendering as foundation.

**Completed:**
- Board rendering with CSS Grid (3x3 grid, classic # lines)
- Restructured milestones: basic 3x3 first, then super-ify
- ADR for HTML+CSS rendering decision
- Clean separation: CSS in `style.css`, HTML generation in Rust
- Cell struct with position awareness and render method
- Data attributes (`data-row`, `data-col`) for CSS targeting

**Discovered:**
- CSS gap+background has subpixel issues at 1-2px; borders more reliable
- Inline `?` can confuse type inference with deref coercion; explicit bindings help
- Trunk `data-trunk` directives must stay in HTML (build-time)

**Decisions:**
- HTML+CSS over Canvas — see `docs/dev/adr/2026-02-03-000-htmlcss-rendering-for-super-tic-tac-toe.md`
- Start with basic 3x3, super-ify later

**Next:** Input handling (click/touch to place X/O)
